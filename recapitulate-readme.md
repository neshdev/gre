# Argument
Argument - an argument is made up of both conclusions and evidences

* A main conclusion is claim the author is trying to persuade to reader to believe is true. These statement standalone and do not help support anything else. Everything else in a passage will help support this claim.

* Evidences are a set of premises that help support the conclusion.

* A sub conclusion can act as both conclusions and evidence. However, they are not independent and most of the time will help support another claim.

A conclusion can have various degrees of confidence.

A definite conclusion makes categorical claims such as 'all' or 'no-one'
A indefinite conclusion varies in gradations between the max and min categorical claim. Examples include nearly, sometimes, many, some, and etc...

# Conclusion

Conclusions can be partitioned abstractly into 6 different sets.

1. Causation
2. Comparison
3. Assessment
4. Recommendation
5. Prediction
6. Simple Beliefs

## Causation

A causation conclusion will have a cause and effect scenario.

It will most often be the case that X -> Y. However, there are two distinct ways to strengthen ore weaken this claim.

To weaken
    1. prove that Z -> Y instead of X -> Y (Alternation explanation)
    2. prove that Y -> X instead of X -> Y (False causation from correlation)

To strengthen this claim:
    1. State how the weaken cases are not possible

It is also possible to add conditionals for causation statements. A->B->C->D

## Comparison

A comparison conclusion will try to compare two things against each other or a single thing with itself.

single thing:
Ex: Lebron with experience is better than Lebron when he first entered the NBA.

two things:
Ex: Motor cycles are faster than cars

## Assessment 

An assessment conclusion will try to give a certain subjective attribute to an object.

Ex: Flowers are beautiful

## Recommendation

A recommendation conclusion will try to raise an action(for/against) based on subjective beliefs.

Ex: A new grocery store should be built because the closest one is 30 miles away.

## Prediction

A prediction conclusion will usually try to infer a future event.

A prediction conclusion is normally weak to the 'time elapsed' tactic.

    The future has something that made a thing in the past obsolete or a non worry.
    Something has changed in the future that is no longer a concern.

## Simple Belief

A simple belief is catch all for a conclusion that does not nicely fit into the above categories. All conclusion could be called simple beliefs, but it is better to categorize them more specifically into their own sets.

# Evidences

Evidences are premises that are used to support the conclusion.

Below is the list of most common types of evidences

    Evidences
    1. Examples
    2. Appeal
    3. Analogy
    4. Past/History
    5. Study / Samples

    Rebuttals
    1. Counter Examples
    2. Alternate Explanation

    Other types of evidences
    1. Conditionals
    2. Causation from correlation

# Flaws

What is the difference between a flaw and weakening a conclusion.
A flaw is an argument that is already unsound. A conclusion could have support that is weak, but not necessarily unsound.

These are the most common type of flaws
1. Sampling Bias
2. Ad hominem
3. Over generalization
4. Percent vs Quantity
5. Causation from correlation
6. False Dichotomy
7. Faulty Analogy
8. Lack of evidence
9. Certainty vs Possibility
10. Circular Reasoning
11. Equivocation


# Necessary Assumptions

A necessary assumption is something that is not explicitly stated but is fundamental for the conclusion to be sound.

Negating a necessary assumption will break the conclusion.

* This is not the same as strengthening an argument.

Tip
* Find the gap or **overlooked possibility**

# Sufficient Assumption

A sufficient assumption is something that is not stated but can be inferred from the passage.

It is something that seamlessly connects an argument's evidence with its conclusion. This is normally a gap.

Tip: You can normally predict a an answer for the gap.

You can test is by affirming. This means that when this assumption is added, it will **logically** connect assumptions, evidences and main conclusions.

# Explain or Resolve

1. Explain in your own words
2. Find the surprising element
**3. Turn the conclusion in a question**
4. Fill in the hole / Evaluate the choices

# Identify the Role

1. Find the MC
2. Find the Evidences
3. Find the Statement that is given
4. Explain how it is used with the MC and evidences.

# Strengthen / Weaken

1. Identify the MC
2. Identify the Evidences
3. Fill in the gaps
4. Add the choice with the evidences to evaluate the conclusion.

Tip: It is normally hard to predict an answer and it is better to evaluate each choice.
