Question Type: Weaken

Main Conclusion: Improving workers environment increases workers productivity. This is a causation conclusion.

Evidence:
* Working in pleasant surroundings were 25% more productivity than their peers in unpleasant surroundings.
* Objective criteria: caseload and complexity of cases

Causation from Correlation(observation)
Tactic:
1. if X -> Y then show Z -> Y
2. if observation is X -> Y, then can be weakened if actually Y -> X

a) **On average, less-productive employees spend no fewer hours per day at their workstations than do their more-productive peers.** Doesn't mention unpleasant environment. So, not relevant. 

b) **Unpleasant surroundings give employees less motivation to work hard than more pleasant surroundings do.** This would strengthen the argument.

c) **The more-productive employees are generally rewarded with pleasant office spaces.** This explains the correlation of environment and productivity. This can be an alternate explanation or the opposite correlation from what was observed.

d) **More-productive employees do not work any more hours than their less-productive peers.** This doesn't account for unpleasant environment. So, not Relevant.

e) **Peer pressure discourages employees in crowded, unpleasant surroundings from making phone calls to their own family members during work time** This is off topic.
